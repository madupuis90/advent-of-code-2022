# Advent of Code 2022 in Rust

## Introduction

I wanted to try Rust for a while now and this is my first time using it. I'm trying to refer to official docs while working through the problems so it is taking a while. 

Do NOT assume this is good Rust code. I'm still a beginner and I'm probably doing stupid stuff just to make my program compile.

## Repo structure
The code is divided into multiple folders. There is one folder per day and each day contains its own `main.rs` file and `cargo.tml`.
This means that to run the code for a specific day, you need to `cd day<X>` and run `cargo run`.

Each folders contains `part_1.rs` and `part_2.rs` which returns the answer of each respective parts. 
To print the answer (part 1|2 and sample|input) that you want, you need to uncomment the line you want in `main.rs`.
